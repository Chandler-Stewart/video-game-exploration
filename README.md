# video-game-exploration

**The Aim** - We have information on over 16,000 video games. It includes information on the characteristics of the video game, the sales of the video game around the world, and the critique information provided by its audience. The goal of this project is to examine the video game historical information to fine similarities between demographics. Exploring the data may prove market drivers that can create triple A title games.

Strategies include:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Hypothesis Testing
